# =================================================================== FUNCTIONS
# 1. Write a function called status_of(percent) that returns "OVER LIMIT"
#    (100% or more), "WARNING" (90% or more), or "OK" (anything else).
def status_of(percent):
    """Returns the status based on the percentage."""
    if percent >= 100:
        return "OVER LIMIT"
    elif percent >= 90:
        return "WARNING"
    else:
        return "OK"
#    Typical and above: also write check(value, limit) that returns the
#    difference and the percentage as two values - do not print anything
#    inside it, only calculate and return.
def check(value, limit):
    """Calculates the difference and percentage based on value and limit."""
    difference = value - limit
    percent = (value / limit) * 100
    return difference, percent
#
#    Excellent: also write print_report(label, value, limit, difference,
#    percent, status) that does ALL of the printing below - nothing outside
#    it should contain a print() of its own.
#
#    Give each function a one-line docstring saying what it does.

# your function(s) go here
def print_report(label, value, limit, difference, percent, status):
    """Prints the report based on the provided values."""
    print()
    print("=" * 34)
    print(f"  RECORD CHECK  -  {label}")
    print("=" * 34)
    print(f"label: {label}")
    print(f"value: {value:10.2f}")
    print(f"limit: {limit:10.2f}")
    print(f"difference: {difference:9.2f}")
    print(f"percent: {percent:10.2f}")
    print(f"status: {status}")
    print("=" * 34)


# ==================================================================== INPUT
# 2. Ask for your three values.
#
#    - the first is TEXT      (a name, a hostname, an IP)  -> no conversion needed
#    - the second is a NUMBER (use float(), not int())
#    - the third  is a NUMBER (use float(), not int())

label = input("Enter a name: ")    # replace with an input() call
value = float(input("Enter the value: "))     # replace with an input() call, converted
limit = float(input("Enter the limit: "))     # replace with an input() call, converted


# ================================================================== PROCESS
# 3. Work out the difference, the percentage, and the status.
#
#    Threshold : call status_of() to get the status. Work out the
#                difference and percentage inline, not in a function.
#    Typical   : call check() to get the difference and percentage instead.

difference = value - limit   # replace with your code
percent = (value / limit)* 100    # replace with your code
status = status_of(percent)          # replace with your code


# =================================================================== OUTPUT
# 4. Print the report.
print(f"label: {label}")
print(f"value: {value}")
print(f"limit: {limit}")
print(f"difference: {difference:.2f}")
print(f"percent: {percent:.2f}%")
print(f"status: {status}")
#
#    Threshold : the three values you were given, plus status, inside a border
#    Typical   : add difference and percent, 2 decimal places, right-aligned
#    Excellent : call print_report() instead of printing directly here, and
#                wrap sections 2-4 in a loop so you can check as many records
#                as you like in one run - type "quit" as the label to stop.
#                Keep count of how many came back OVER LIMIT and print that
#                once, after the loop ends.

print()
print("=" * 34)

print(f"difference: {difference:.2f}")
print(f"percent: {percent:.2f}%")

# ==========================================================================
# 5. Before you finish:
#
#    [ ] Run it three times with different numbers
#    [ ] Run it with a total of 0 and note the error (do not fix it yet)
#    [ ] Check every function does one job - if a function both calculates
#        and prints, split it
